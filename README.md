# Open Plug-and-Produce Manufacturing Service Bus

## Overview

Plug-and-produce is an information intensive process that requires from both the devices being plugged and the system a structured information exchange about the operational context and associated constraints. This service bus implementation will enable the seamless registration of the manufacturing components and support a cloud based modular deployment for the cyber representation of the same.

## Features

* Device discovery and registration
* OPC-UA and DDS (experimental) support
* openMOS Semantic Model (AML) browing
* Skill-based execution handling
* Cloud interaction via webservices
